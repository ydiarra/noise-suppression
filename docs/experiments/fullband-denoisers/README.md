# Experiment: fullband denoisers vs DTLN

Question: can an open-source model replace DTLN and bring WorkAdventure's microphone quality closer to Meet, Teams or
Krisp? DTLN runs at 16 kHz, so nothing above 8 kHz is ever sent.

Candidates: DeepFilterNet3 (48 kHz, MIT/Apache-2.0) and DPDFNet (Ceva, 2025, Apache-2.0, 16 and 48 kHz variants).

## Quality (offline, `run_eval.py` → `results.md`)

Main set: 50 random pairs of the VoiceBank+DEMAND test set (48 kHz, CC-BY 4.0).

| model | PESQ-WB | STOI | SI-SDR | DNSMOS OVRL | LSD 8-24 kHz (dB, lower is better) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| noisy input | 2.07 | 0.93 | 9.7 | 2.77 | 12.3 |
| DTLN (prod) | 2.52 | 0.92 | 17.3 | 2.99 | 56.9 (nothing above 8 kHz) |
| **DeepFilterNet3** | **3.22** | **0.95** | **19.2** | **3.23** | **8.9** |
| DPDFNet2 48k | 3.13 | 0.94 | 18.8 | 3.15 | 16.2 |
| DPDFNet8 48k | 3.02 | 0.93 | 18.8 | 3.15 | 17.7 |

On the three real noisy clips in `clips/` (16 kHz sources, DNSMOS OVRL only), DPDFNet8 leads (3.19), then DPDFNet2 48k
(3.09), DFN3 (3.02) and DTLN (2.76).

## Cost in the browser (`fullband-compare.html`)

The page renders a clip through each engine's real AudioWorklet in an `OfflineAudioContext`. Measured on an Apple M4 in
Chrome, one audio thread, restaurant clip, 3 runs:

| engine | real-time factor |
|---|---|
| DTLN (LiteRT.js, 16 kHz) | 0.019–0.020 |
| DeepFilterNet3 (libDF wasm, 48 kHz) | 0.013 |

DPDFNet was not ported to the browser. It needs TFLite resource variables (`VAR_HANDLE`/`ASSIGN_VARIABLE`), and it
costs 0.20 real-time factor natively on one M4 core for the 48k model (DPDFNet2), about 7× DeepFilterNet3. It would not
hold real time in a worklet on an ordinary laptop.

## Attenuation limit: required

With no limit (100 dB), DeepFilterNet3 gates the background of `restaurant_noisy.wav` to digital silence between words:
39 silent gaps longer than 5 ms, up to 620 ms. Listeners hear dropouts, pumping and a metallic, unnatural background.
With a 12, 20 or 30 dB limit there are no gaps after start-up; the background stays, attenuated by that amount. The page
now defaults to 25 dB. The offline scores above used no limit, so they may flatter aggressive suppression.

### Pause gate

A fixed high limit removes more background but brings back abrupt gating. A first attempt glided the libDF limit down
in pauses; listeners heard the first syllable after a pause clipped (the limit came back up too late).

The page now keeps DFN3 at 25 dB and adds a gate after it: voice activity is read on the denoised output (speech stands
far above the residual whatever the noise), the output is delayed 30 ms so the gate reopens before the first syllable,
and pauses get up to 20 dB more attenuation (100 ms hangover, 60 dB/s release).

Measured on `clean-voice.wav` repeated with 0.8 s and 1.5 s pauses plus noise at 5 dB SNR ("clean voice + ..." clips on
the page), so the speech position is known:

| noise | pause attenuation, fixed 25 | pause attenuation, gate 25 → 45 | audible speech lowered > 3 dB by the gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| airconditioning | 20.3 dB | 25.9 dB | 0 ms |
| restaurant | 19.6 dB | 31.2 dB | 0 ms |
| white noise | 25.1 dB | 37.0 dB | 0 ms |

Abrupt 10 ms level jumps over 20 dB on the real clips stay at the fixed-25 level (3-5), against 15-56 for a fixed 45 dB
limit. Cost: 30 ms of latency. Babble (restaurant) stays the hardest case: the noise is voices.

## Conclusion

DeepFilterNet3 is better than DTLN on every metric, sends fullband audio and is cheaper in the browser. DPDFNet is
slightly better on real 16 kHz clips but too heavy for the browser. Recommended next step: add DeepFilterNet3 as an
engine of this package.

## Reproduce

- Browser: `./scripts/fetch-deepfilternet3.sh`, `npm run dev`, open `/fullband-compare.html`. Its "Live" buttons A/B
  the microphone through each engine (use headphones).
- Offline: `uv venv --python 3.11 && uv pip install -r requirements.lock.txt`, then download the VoiceBank+DEMAND test
  set (https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2791, `clean_testset_wav` and `noisy_testset_wav`) into `vbd/` next to
  `run_eval.py`, run `python run_eval.py`, then `python report.py`. Put the DNSMOS `sig_bak_ovr.onnx` and `model_v8.onnx` in `dnsmos/`, from
  https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge/tree/master/DNSMOS.

Limits: PESQ, STOI and DNSMOS work at 16 kHz and cannot reward the band above 8 kHz; LSD 8-24 kHz is the only fullband
measure. The sample is small (50 pairs). DeepFilterNet3 ran on whole files offline in Python, so its streaming delay was
not measured there (libDF: 20 ms window, 10 ms hop, 2-frame look-ahead, about 40 ms).
